Lab simulations for the subject Introduction to Complex Systems fall of 2023 given by Dr. Maximino Aldana from C3, UNAM.

1. *covid* has a log-normal approximation of the daily amount of cases generated via a genetic algorithm. 
2. *redes* has the code for generating a Krapivsky-Redner-Leyvraz network with alpha=0.5,1,1.5 with 2000 nodes and 100,000 nodes as well. And their graphs approximating their growth.
